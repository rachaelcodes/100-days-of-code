# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 43: March 6
**Today's Progress:** Adding image to one-page

**Thoughts:** Styling my photo on the one-page was surprisingly fiddly

**Next Steps:**
* Add F/C toggle button to weather app 
* Scrolling for images in writing prompt generator, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 41-2: March 4-5
**Today's Progress:** Updating design for one-page and styling randomizer

**Thoughts:** One-page now at a 'useable' state - a couple more tweaks needed (add own image, maybe smaller res jpg, and experiment more with colours of thumbnails). Styling randomizer looks a lot better with more text - page more balanced.

**Next Steps:**
* Add F/C toggle button to weather app 
* Scrolling for images in writing prompt generator, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 40: March 2 (with prep on March 1), 2017
**Today's Progress:** Started putting new one-page together

**Thoughts:** it's still at the 'ugly' skeleton phase, but the bones are there 

**Next Steps:**
* add image to one-page, more styling (plus a mouse-over effect)
* Add F/C toggle button to weather app 
* Scrolling for images in writing prompt generator, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 37-9: Feb 25-28, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Published kata! and editing based on comments.

**Thoughts:** gitter group was helpful for allaying my worries about a message saying the js was unsupported :) Comments on Codewars were really helpful too.

**Next Steps:**
* Add F/C toggle button to weather app 
* Scrolling for images in writing prompt generator, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 36: Feb 23, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Starting putting kata on Codewars (including my solution)

**Thoughts:** a couple of problems have come up: it says my JS is out of date (will x-ref code) and one of the tests isn't working - despite the solutions appearing to be identical

**Next Steps:**
* Create randomised tests for kata! Sort out problems and check against cheat techniques
* Add F/C toggle button to weather app 
* Scrolling for images in writing prompt generator, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3

### Day 33: Feb 15, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Updated Weather app

**Thoughts:** Much easier to add new API this time (learning's great, isn't it?), though there was one annoying moment when one element being called was embedded in an extra array.

**Next Steps:**
* Add F/C toggle button to weather app 
* Scrolling for images in writing prompt generator, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Weather app](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/weathering/)

### Day 32: Feb 13, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Finished basic writing prompt generator

**Thoughts:** Some outstanding issues - removing potrait (rather than landscape) photos from the collection. Also, couldn't find way to get image scrolling, would work better with it.

**Next Steps:**
* Change API source to openweather 
* Scrolling for images in writing prompt generator, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 26: Feb 2, 2017 
**Today's Progress:** Putting basics of writing prompt generator code together.

**Thoughts:** The API I'm using for random images doesn't let me reload, so tomorrow I'll be looking at using iframes to get it working

**Next Steps:**
* Create iframes for writing prompt generator; add instructions for users; image credits
* Change API source to openweather, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird); perhaps look out for more problems that involve mathematical thinking
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Writing prompt repo](https://github.com/rachaelcodes/story-lottery) 

### Day 25: Feb 1, 2017

**Next Steps:**
* Change API source to openweather, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird); perhaps look out for more problems that involve mathematical thinking

**Links to work:** [GitHub repository for quote app](https://github.com/rachaelcodes/quoted) 

### Day 23: January 26, 2016 
**Today's Progress:** Took API off git for weathering app. Started work on quote app.

**Thoughts:** Need to change API source to one that doesn't charge for projects hosted on Git

**Next Steps:**
* Change API source to openweather, next stages of quote app, CSS daily images day 3
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird); perhaps look out for more problems that involve mathematical thinking
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** Quote app - not committed yet

### Days 20-22: January 23-25 
**Today's Progress:** simple JS algorithm challenges; revising the methods I've been practicing

**Thoughts:** Some better memory than before - still a WIP. 

**Next Steps:**
* Work on new app project (probably random writing prompt generator), CSS daily images day 3
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird); perhaps look out for more problems that involve mathematical thinking
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Freecodecamp profile](https://www.freecodecamp.com/rachaelcodes)

### Day 19: January 22
**Today's Progress:** Finished another Codewars challenge. Also started work on creating flashcards for revising JS basics

**Thoughts:** The maths of the problem was probably the hardest part - reminds me of how little algebra I've done (my maths problem-solving brain is a bit rusty at the moment)

**Next Steps:**
* Work on new app project (probably random writing prompt generator), CSS daily images day 3
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird); perhaps look out for more problems that involve mathematical thinking
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Codewars solutions](https://www.codewars.com/users/curiousrabbit/completed_solutions)

### Day 18: January 21
**Today's Progress:** JavaScript problem solving (with Eloquent Javascript)

**Thoughts:** Coding offline was a useful way to point out what I didn't remember about syntax

**Next Steps:**
* Work on new app project (random writing prompt generator), CSS images day 3 
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird)
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) etc to all projects


### Day 17: January 19
**Today's Progress:** Made a character counting app (adapting from enlight's text editor).

**Thoughts:** For the first time, I've created something that I needed to use and realised I could make. The basic functionality is there, though I could tart it up a bit - particularly if I get more confident with CSS images, as it's crying out for a mock Dracula logo.
(Yes, I missed two days, I know it should mean I'm off the challenge. But I want to keep going. I've actually missed this a lot.)

**Next Steps:**
* Work on new app project (random writing prompt generator), CSS images day 3 
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird)
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) etc to all projects

**Links to work:** [character counting app](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/Count-Characula/)

### Day 16: January 16
**Today's Progress:** #dailycssimages number 2 - an elephant

**Thoughts:** I did the elephant in silhouette, to focus on the shapes. Still not really happy with it. I'm finding this an unbelieveably fiddly process - not sure it is for me. But is definitely getting me to think about simplifying shapes (what's the minimum number of shapes/elements to make it clear what it is AND visually appealing (ok, maybe I should aim for the first!))

**Next Steps:**
* Work on new app project (turning text editor into a character counter?), CSS images day 3 
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird)
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) etc to all projects

**Links to work:** [CSS image 2 - elephant](http://codepen.io/rachaelcodes/full/WRGVRov)

### Day 15: January 15
**Today's Progress:** Finished styling of basic weather app (with random pictures tied to weather conditions)

**Thoughts:** It's funny how much can be solved with a simple fix - I thought I'd called on API data incorrectly and didn't really understand the process, when it turned out I'd forgotten to use "" in a switch case string. 

**Next Steps:**
* Work on new app project (turning text editor into a character counter?), CSS images day 2 
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird)
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) etc to all projects

**Links to work:** [Weather app](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/weathering/)

### Day 14: January 14 
**Today's Progress:** Finished a couple of Codewars challenges I'd left ages ago

**Thoughts:** It's nice to return to old unfinished things to see how much I've learned. Progress can still feel slow, though. There was one I found tricky because I couldn't even understand how they'd defined the function. Definitely something to get back to 

**Next Steps:**
* Continue working on weathering app - expanding functionality with different elements of Dark Sky API (maybe also an image function using Unsplash's API)
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and look up how they've defined the function in the one I found weird)
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Codewars solutions](https://www.codewars.com/users/curiousrabbit/completed_solutions)

### Day 13: January 13
**Today's Progress:** Finished CSS cheetah cub (for now). Basics of weather app in place and functioning!

**Thoughts:** So I hadn't got a lot of the steps on the weather app right (especially JSON - definitely need some revision on that), though I also found myself debugging some of the steps suggested by Enlight. 

**Next Steps:**
* Continue working on weathering app - expanding functionality with different elements of Dark Sky API (maybe also an image function using Unsplash's API)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Daily CSS #1: Cheetah cub](http://codepen.io/rachaelcodes/full/wgGZVX/) [Weather app](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/weathering/)

### Day 12: January 12 
**Today's Progress:** Had a go at Daily CSS challenge (I won't be actually doing it daily).

**Thoughts:** Definitely over-complicated it - but I have my sketches to return to when I'm stronger at CSS. 

**Next Steps:**
* Complete cub on CSS; continue working on weathering app
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Daily CSS #1: Cheetah cub](http://codepen.io/rachaelcodes/full/wgGZVX/)

### Day 11: January 11 
**Today's Progress:** Started new project.

**Thoughts:** Had a go at a weather app, with guidance from enlight.ml - I'm looking at the steps and having a go at solving them first, before checking against the example. Finding I'm able to do more this time straight away.

**Next Steps:**
* Continue working on weather app (and CSS30 when I get the emails)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Weather app - unfinished and very buggy](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/weathering/)


### Day 10: January 10
**Today's Progress:** Paired programming: supported a JS beginner, helping her debug her code

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed helping someone think through their code, a reminder of where I've come from, and helped clarify the things I was less sure about (return only works once, right?)

**Next Steps:**
* Choose next project (the CSS 30 challenge looks interesting)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 9: January 9
**Today's Progress:** Not a lot finished, but revised Regexp for Codewars.

**Thoughts:**  Tried the video tutorial again, but I don't think I'm at the right level yet, plus I prefer something that encourages more experimentation. Might take some ideas from them when I have a bit more JS knowledge,

**Next Steps:**
* Choose next project (still!). Enlight.ml tutorials seem to work for me - they are pitched at about my level, so I learn enough to start experimenting further, but don't forget the mountain of new terms.
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 8: January 7
**Today's Progress:** Reached 6kyu on Codewars.

**Thoughts:** Satisfying levelling up. But have been struggling to focus after that. Tried a video tutorial for a js app, but think text works better for me.

**Next Steps:**
* Choose next project (still!)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Codewars solutions](https://www.codewars.com/users/curiousrabbit/completed_solutions)

### Day 7: January 6
**Today's Progress:** Completed the features of the styling randomizer. I could do more styling on it, but I want to focus on JS at the moment.

**Thoughts:** First project seen all the way through! Woop!

**Next Steps:**
* Choose next project!
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** [Styling Randomizer](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/styling-randomizer/)


### Day 6: January 5
**Today's Progress:** Updated the container formatting of the styling randomizer (including using new flexbox knowledge). Added a new color change option with a 'focus' box. 

**Thoughts:** It's really satisfying realizing my ideas for adapting and developing a project. Could have carried on longer, which I know means I've left it in a good space for tomorrow. 

**Next Steps:**
* Sort out the text color change option
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** [Styling Randomizer](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/styling-randomizer/)

### Day 5: January 4
**Today's Progress:** Took a break from projects for some CodeWars practice. Which didn't go very well. Thought I nearly had it, then ended up with the error messages I couldn't parse.

**Thoughts:** Disappointing day. It might be one where it's worth coming back to when I have a bit more knowledge. (Or next time I'm at a pair coding session)

**Next Steps:**
* Sort out the 'help' box formatting
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and ask for advice about today's kata)
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** not really worth it for today - it's on my CodeWars page (linked elsewhere)

### Day 4: January 3
**Today's Progress:** Decided I wanted to use flexbox in the styling-randomizer; used [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) to learn it; did. Found I had a conflict between GitHub and home directory; sorted that. Created a help box for the styling-randomizer (looking up HTML5 alternatives to divs), but formatting still a bit horrible.

**Thoughts:** I really like using projects to determine what skills I develop when. Unfortunately, various other hitches meant that I didn't really get the flexbox styling as I'd like it. Will probably need to revise tomorrow.

As expected, I needed reminders for using the Terminal commands. Formatting problems also raised the issue of websites rendering very differently in different browsers - a reminder to try it out in more than one, as well as considering universality of different features. 

**Next Steps:**
* Sort out the 'help' box formatting
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** [Styling Randomizer](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/styling-randomizer/)

### Day 3: January 2
**Today's Progress:** Learnt how to use the Terminal. Then how to use the Terminal to add to projects on GitHub - added old styling randomizer files. Also added another [Enlight.ml](https://enlight.ml/) project folder to a new repo on GitHub - again, using the Terminal.

**Thoughts:** How will I remember all those commands? I guess I'll be returning a lot to Terminal how-tos. 
I think there are some things I'll always prefer doing not on Terminal (e.g. copying files) - in some ways, I work quite visually. I guess it's about whatever leads to the tidiest workflow. Also, it doesn't do well with file names including spaces. Speech marks seemed OK as a workaround, but it's something I'll bear in mind when naming directories in the future.
Also, I made a very minor (>1 line of code) change to a file, which didn't get picked up as a change on either GitHub Desktop or in the Terminal. 

**Next Steps:**
* Make changes to styling randomizer (leave text editor for now)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** [Text Editor](https://github.com/rachaelcodes/text-editor) - it's a real mess at the moment.

### Day 2: January 1, 2017 
**UPDATE:** Completed an extra Codewars kata - a 5kyu one!

**Today's Progress:** Completed first 6kyu challenge on CodeWars - BitCounting. Updating this log via GitHub desktop. Also, added licence to the GitHub profile page.

**Thoughts:** My experience of pair programming last month taught me a lot: using repl.it and console.log to test parts of code; I've also commented more carefully.  

**Next Steps:**
* Upload existing work to the styling randomizer
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub, then add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Codewars solutions](https://www.codewars.com/users/curiousrabbit/completed_solutions)


### Day 1: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress:** Downloaded and learnt basics of GitHub Desktop, including adding html files from my computer. Set up GitHub pages for myself and for the first project I'll be fiddling around with.

**Thoughts:** Git had seemed mysterious and difficult; it's been pretty straightforward (though just as well I was used to Markdown!). Timing's been a bit tricky - haven't quite managed to fit a whole hour between finishing work and going out - though I guess that's NYE for you.

**Next Steps:** 
* Add a licence and an 'ignore' file to the main GitHub profile page.
* Upload existing work to the styling randomizer
* Keep practicing CodeWars
