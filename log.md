# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 1, 2016 

**Today's Progress:** Completed first 6kyu challenge on CodeWars - BitCounting. Updating this log via GitHub desktop.

**Thoughts:** My experience of pair programming last month taught me a lot: using repl.it and console.log to test parts of code; I've also commented more carefully.  

**Next Steps:** Mostly unchanged from yesterday
* Add a licence and an 'ignore' file to the main GitHub profile page.
* Upload existing work to the styling randomizer
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub

### Day 1: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress:** Downloaded and learnt basics of GitHub Desktop, including adding html files from my computer. Set up GitHub pages for myself and for the first project I'll be fiddling around with.

**Thoughts:** Git had seemed mysterious and difficult; it's been pretty straightforward (though just as well I was used to Markdown!). Timing's been a bit tricky - haven't quite managed to fit a whole hour between finishing work and going out - though I guess that's NYE for you.

**Next Steps:** 
* Add a licence and an 'ignore' file to the main GitHub profile page.
* Upload existing work to the styling randomizer
* Keep practicing CodeWars
