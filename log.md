# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 3: January 2, 2016
**Today's Progress:** Learnt how to use the Terminal. Then how to use the Terminal to add to projects on GitHub - added old styling randomizer files. Also added another [Enlight.ml](https://enlight.ml/) project folder to a new repo on GitHub - again, using the Terminal.

**Thoughts:** How will I remember all those shortcuts? I guess I'll be returning a lot to Terminal how-tos. 
I think there are some things I'll always prefer doing not on Terminal (e.g. copying files) - in some ways, I work quite visually. I guess it's about whatever leads to the tidiest workflow. Also, it doesn't do well with file names including spaces. Speech marks seemed OK as a workaround, but it's something I'll bear in mind when naming directories in the future.
Also, I made a very minor (>1 line of code) change to a file, which didn't get picked up as a change on either GitHub Desktop or in the Terminal. 

**Next Steps:**
* Make changes to styling randomizer (leave text editor for now)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** [Text Editor](https://github.com/rachaelcodes/text-editor) - it's a real mess at the moment.

### Day 2: January 1, 2016 
**UPDATE:** Completed an extra Codewars kata - a 5kyu one!

**Today's Progress:** Completed first 6kyu challenge on CodeWars - BitCounting. Updating this log via GitHub desktop. Also, added licence to the GitHub profile page.

**Thoughts:** My experience of pair programming last month taught me a lot: using repl.it and console.log to test parts of code; I've also commented more carefully.  

**Next Steps:**
* Upload existing work to the styling randomizer
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub, then add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 1: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress:** Downloaded and learnt basics of GitHub Desktop, including adding html files from my computer. Set up GitHub pages for myself and for the first project I'll be fiddling around with.

**Thoughts:** Git had seemed mysterious and difficult; it's been pretty straightforward (though just as well I was used to Markdown!). Timing's been a bit tricky - haven't quite managed to fit a whole hour between finishing work and going out - though I guess that's NYE for you.

**Next Steps:** 
* Add a licence and an 'ignore' file to the main GitHub profile page.
* Upload existing work to the styling randomizer
* Keep practicing CodeWars
