# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: January 13, 2016 
**Today's Progress:** Finished CSS cheetah cub (for now). Basics of weather app in place and functioning!

**Thoughts:** So I hadn't got a lot of the steps on the weather app right (especially JSON - definitely need some revision on that), though I also found myself debugging some of the steps suggested by Enlight. 

**Next Steps:**
* Complete cub on CSS; continue working on weathering app - expanding functionality with different elements of Dark Sky API (maybe also an image function using Unsplash's API)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub, then add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 12: January 12, 2016 
**Today's Progress:** Had a go at Daily CSS challenge (I won't be actually doing it daily).

**Thoughts:** Definitely over-complicated it - but I have my sketches to return to when I'm stronger at CSS. 

**Next Steps:**
* Complete cub on CSS; continue working on weathering app
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub, then add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 11: January 11, 2016 
**Today's Progress:** Started new project.

**Thoughts:** Had a go at a weather app, with guidance from enlight.ml - I'm looking at the steps and having a go at solving them first, before checking against the example. Finding I'm able to do more this time straight away.

**Next Steps:**
* Continue working on weather app (and CSS30 when I get the emails)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub, then add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

**Links to work:** [Weather app - unfinished and very buggy](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/weathering/)


### Day 10: January 10, 2016 
**Today's Progress:** Paired programming: supported a JS beginner, helping her debug her code

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed helping someone think through their code, a reminder of where I've come from, and helped clarify the things I was less sure about (return only works once, right?)

**Next Steps:**
* Choose next project (the CSS 30 challenge looks interesting)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub, then add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 9: January 9, 2016 
**Today's Progress:** Not a lot finished, but revised Regexp for Codewars.

**Thoughts:**  Tried the video tutorial again, but I don't think I'm at the right level yet, plus I prefer something that encourages more experimentation. Might take some ideas from them when I have a bit more JS knowledge,

**Next Steps:**
* Choose next project (still!). Enlight.ml tutorials seem to work for me - they are pitched at about my level, so I learn enough to start experimenting further, but don't forget the mountain of new terms.
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub, then add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 8: January 7, 2016 
**Today's Progress:** Reached 6kyu on Codewars.

**Thoughts:** Satisfying levelling up. But have been struggling to focus after that. Tried a video tutorial for a js app, but think text works better for me.

**Next Steps:**
* Choose next project (still!)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub, then add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 7: January 6, 2016
**Today's Progress:** Completed the features of the styling randomizer. I could do more styling on it, but I want to focus on JS at the moment.

**Thoughts:** First project seen all the way through! Woop!

**Next Steps:**
* Choose next project!
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** [Styling Randomizer](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/styling-randomizer/)


### Day 6: January 5, 2016
**Today's Progress:** Updated the container formatting of the styling randomizer (including using new flexbox knowledge). Added a new color change option with a 'focus' box. 

**Thoughts:** It's really satisfying realizing my ideas for adapting and developing a project. Could have carried on longer, which I know means I've left it in a good space for tomorrow. 

**Next Steps:**
* Sort out the text color change option
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

### Day 5: January 4, 2016
**Today's Progress:** Took a break from projects for some CodeWars practice. Which didn't go very well. Thought I nearly had it, then ended up with the error messages I couldn't parse.

**Thoughts:** Disappointing day. It might be one where it's worth coming back to when I have a bit more knowledge. (Or next time I'm at a pair coding session)

**Next Steps:**
* Sort out the 'help' box formatting
* Keep practicing CodeWars (and ask for advice about today's kata)
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** not really worth it for today - it's on my CodeWars page (linked elsewhere)

### Day 4: January 3, 2016
**Today's Progress:** Decided I wanted to use flexbox in the styling-randomizer; used [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) to learn it; did. Found I had a conflict between GitHub and home directory; sorted that. Created a help box for the styling-randomizer (looking up HTML5 alternatives to divs), but formatting still a bit horrible.

**Thoughts:** I really like using projects to determine what skills I develop when. Unfortunately, various other hitches meant that I didn't really get the flexbox styling as I'd like it. Will probably need to revise tomorrow.

As expected, I needed reminders for using the Terminal commands. Formatting problems also raised the issue of websites rendering very differently in different browsers - a reminder to try it out in more than one, as well as considering universality of different features. 

**Next Steps:**
* Sort out the 'help' box formatting
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** [Styling Randomizer](https://rachaelcodes.github.io/styling-randomizer/)

### Day 3: January 2, 2016
**Today's Progress:** Learnt how to use the Terminal. Then how to use the Terminal to add to projects on GitHub - added old styling randomizer files. Also added another [Enlight.ml](https://enlight.ml/) project folder to a new repo on GitHub - again, using the Terminal.

**Thoughts:** How will I remember all those commands? I guess I'll be returning a lot to Terminal how-tos. 
I think there are some things I'll always prefer doing not on Terminal (e.g. copying files) - in some ways, I work quite visually. I guess it's about whatever leads to the tidiest workflow. Also, it doesn't do well with file names including spaces. Speech marks seemed OK as a workaround, but it's something I'll bear in mind when naming directories in the future.
Also, I made a very minor (>1 line of code) change to a file, which didn't get picked up as a change on either GitHub Desktop or in the Terminal. 

**Next Steps:**
* Make changes to styling randomizer (leave text editor for now)
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to landing page; all 'starter' files to the text-editor repo

**Links to work:** [Text Editor](https://github.com/rachaelcodes/text-editor) - it's a real mess at the moment.

### Day 2: January 1, 2016 
**UPDATE:** Completed an extra Codewars kata - a 5kyu one!

**Today's Progress:** Completed first 6kyu challenge on CodeWars - BitCounting. Updating this log via GitHub desktop. Also, added licence to the GitHub profile page.

**Thoughts:** My experience of pair programming last month taught me a lot: using repl.it and console.log to test parts of code; I've also commented more carefully.  

**Next Steps:**
* Upload existing work to the styling randomizer
* Keep practicing CodeWars
* Learn about using the command-line for working in GitHub, then add 'ignore' files [advice](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)

### Day 1: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress:** Downloaded and learnt basics of GitHub Desktop, including adding html files from my computer. Set up GitHub pages for myself and for the first project I'll be fiddling around with.

**Thoughts:** Git had seemed mysterious and difficult; it's been pretty straightforward (though just as well I was used to Markdown!). Timing's been a bit tricky - haven't quite managed to fit a whole hour between finishing work and going out - though I guess that's NYE for you.

**Next Steps:** 
* Add a licence and an 'ignore' file to the main GitHub profile page.
* Upload existing work to the styling randomizer
* Keep practicing CodeWars
