# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Days 2-3: January 2 + 3
**Today's Progress:** 
* Harry Potter API project: Can now filter data with various categories and have the piechart update
* Started a Codewars Kata, then the tests revealed new criteria; decided to focus on the personal project

**Thoughts:** The filtering was quite laborious, especially when the number of segments changed. I've cleaned up the code quite a bit since then.

**Next Steps:**
* Fix label bug
* Explore smoother data update options
* Add information divs (e.g. people click on a segment and get a list of names)

### Day 1: January 1
**Today's Progress:** 
* Harry Potter API project: Joined up D3 piechart to API data request.
* Rewrote API query to minimise unclassifiable data.
* Did a Codewars Kata, because I need to keep my hand in.

**Thoughts:** This project has been a reminder of how important 'cleaning up' data is, or just making sure we're precise with the questions we're asking it.

**Next Steps:**
* Explore D3 data manipulation options before deciding whether to go down this path or the API route
* Create a 'toggle unknown house' feature
* Write a README!
