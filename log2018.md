# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: January 4
**Today's Progress:** 
* Harry Potter API project: Labels now clearer
* Non-D3 and non-DOM functions now tested

**Thoughts:** 
I was starting to get more ideas for features 

**Next Steps:**
* Styling!
* Make interface more intuitive
* Credit the api

* [first in a series of helpful articles about D3 piecharts](http://www.cagrimmett.com/til/2016/08/19/d3-pie-chart.html)

### Days 2-3: January 2 + 3
**Today's Progress:** 
* Harry Potter API project: Can now filter data with various categories and have the piechart update
* Started a Codewars Kata, then the tests revealed new criteria; decided to focus on the personal project

**Thoughts:** The filtering was quite laborious, especially when the number of segments changed. I've cleaned up the code quite a bit since then.

**Next Steps:**
* Fix label bug
* Explore smoother data update options
* Add information divs (e.g. people click on a segment and get a list of names) **actually done after I'd written up this log**

### Day 1: January 1
**Today's Progress:** 
* Harry Potter API project: Joined up D3 piechart to API data request.
* Rewrote API query to minimise unclassifiable data.
* Did a Codewars Kata, because I need to keep my hand in.

**Thoughts:** This project has been a reminder of how important 'cleaning up' data is, or just making sure we're precise with the questions we're asking it.

**Next Steps:**
* Explore D3 data manipulation options before deciding whether to go down this path or the API route
* Create a 'toggle unknown house' feature
* Write a README!
