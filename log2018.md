# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1
**Today's Progress:** 
* Harry Potter API project: Joined up D3 piechart to API data request.
* Rewrote API query to minimise unclassifiable data.
* Did a Codewars Kata, because I need to keep my hand in.

**Thoughts:** This project has been a reminder of how important 'cleaning up' data is, or just making sure we're precise with the questions we're asking it.

**Next Steps:**
* Explore D3 data manipulation options before deciding whether to go down this path or the API route
* Create a 'toggle unknown house' feature
* Write a README!
